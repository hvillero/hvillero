## Let's talk About Me
Hello there! I'm Hugo Villero, a seasoned developer with a passion that goes beyond code. While I thrive in the realm of web / mobile development and technology, my heart also resonates with the call of nature and the joy of human connection.

## Professional Journey
I'm a senior developer, designer, and architect history. Over the years, I've honed my expertise in **Ruby on Rails**, and I'm also proficient in other programming languages. I have a penchant for **Mac OS** and am enthusiastic about **virtualization**. I'm diving deep into **AI** and **big data processing**, and I am always eager to expand my tech horizons. Meeting people from different cultures and backgrounds in the professional realm enriches my experience and perspective.

## Personal Journey
Originally hailing from Colombia, I've made Toronto, Canada, my home for 20 years. This blend of cultures has enriched my perspective and made me a versatile and adaptable developer.

## Personal Interests
When I'm not coding, you might find me chasing the thrill of **running** or relishing the tranquillity of nature through **hiking** and **camping**. The gentle glide of a **kayak** on water is one of my most cherished experiences.

## Collaboration and Values
I thrive in environments that hold teamwork, innovation, and excellence in high regard. I'm keen to bring my skills and expertise to teams that resonate with these values.

## What Drives Me
Coffee first, but At the core, challenges exhilarate me. The intricate dance of problem-solving, the eureka moments, and the deep satisfaction of finding solutions push me forward. Above all, being part of a cause that brings about tangible good, especially one that uplifts and aids others, is the fuel that ignites my passion.

## What Deters Me
Repetitiveness and lack of purpose in tasks tend to drain my enthusiasm. I thrive on innovation and meaningful contributions.

## Problem-Solving Style: Analytical or Intuitive?
I believe in a balanced approach. While I value the insights that thorough research can provide, there are times when diving in hands-on can lead to better clarity and solutions.

## Feedback always helps
Constructive and candid feedback, preferably face-to-face, works best for me. Knowing the intent of mutual growth makes feedback sessions valuable.

### My Peak Productivity Hours
Early mornings and late evenings are my peak productivity windows. The tranquility of these hours aids in focused and creative thinking.
